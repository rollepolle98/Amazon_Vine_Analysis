# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview and Purpose

Task at hand : analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. First task at hand will be taking the dataset and using PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance then load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Nexti chose to use Pandas to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.

* How many total reviews were there for a review that was or wasn’t written as part of the Vine program?

  * Total amount of reviews = 40,471 non-vine (not paid) reviews and 94 vine (paid) reviews.
  
* How many 5 star reviews were there for a review that was or wasn’t written as part of the Vine program?

  * Total amount of 5 star reviews = 15,663 non-vine (not paid) reviews and 48 vine (paid) reviews.
  
* What is the total percentage of 5 star reviews for or a review that was or wasn’t written as part of the Vine program?

  * Total percentage of 5 star reviews = 38.7% non-vine (not paid) reviews and 51.1% vine (paid) reviews.

## Summary: 

This data suggests that there is a bias toward five-star reviews from paid-reviewers. Reason being is because while the majority of reviews and amount of five star reviews are in favor of non-vine members. It still shows that more than half of vine members reviews are 5 star. That in itself shows bias that paid viewers have. 
A way to have made this unbias would have been further analysis of more samples and knowing how many 1-4 star reviews each viewer left therefore you could see a clear pattern.
